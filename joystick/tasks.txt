Thursday tasks:
---------------

- Task 1:
    Implement a boost feature for movement speed. while the right bumper is pressed, the speed increases, and it decreases while the left bumper is pressed. Otherwise the default would be the speed value.

- Task 2:
    The current implementation for the left thumb and the directional pad controls the left and right treads
    in a way that turns the robot to the left when left is pressed and to the right when right is pressed.

    Your task is to implement the right thumb such that the robot moves left when left is pressed
    (instead of turning left) and moves right when right is pressed (instead of turning right).
    Also implement diagonal movements (e.g move up + left when the right thumb in position 'up + left')

- Task 3:
    Test your implementation against others by racing your robot against theirs.
